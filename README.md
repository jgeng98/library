# Library

Interactive webpage where a user can add books to a library and keep track of them by title, author, number of pages, and status. The library can be sorted in either ascending or descending order for each of the properties (title, author, number of pages, status). The webpage makes use of local storage, so that the library does not disappear upon refresh.
